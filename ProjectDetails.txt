Use the following tables to design and implement the Pomona Transit System using any database product and JDBC. Trip ( TripNumber, StartLocationName, DestinationName)TripOffering ( TripNumber, Date, ScheduledStartTime, SecheduledArrivalTime,                                                                                                      DriverName, BusID)Bus ( BusID, Model,Year)Driver( DriverName,  DriverTelephoneNumber)Stop (StopNumber, StopAddress)ActualTripStopInfo (TripNumber, Date, ScheduledStartTime, StopNumber, SecheduledArrivalTime, ActualStartTime, ActualArrivalTime, NumberOfPassengerIn, NumberOf PassengerOut)TripStopInfo ( TripNumber, StopNumber, SequenceNumber, DrivingTime) The system should deal with at least the following transactions:1. Display the schedule of all trips for a given StartLocationName and Destination Name, and Date. In addition to these attributes, the schedule includes: Scheduled StartTime,  ScheduledArrivalTime , DriverID, and BusID.    2. Edit the schedule i.e. edit the table of Trip Offering as follows:-Delete a trip offering specified by Trip#, Date, and ScheduledStartTime;-Add a set of trip offerings assuming the values of all attributes are given (the software asks if you have more trips to enter) ;- Change the driver for a given Trip offering (i.e given TripNumber, Date, ScheduledStartTime);- Change the bus for a given Trip offering.3. Display the stops of a given trip ( i.e. the attributes of the table TripStopInfo).4. Display the weekly schedule of a given driver and date.5. Add a drive.6. Add a bus.7. Delete a bus.8. Record (insert) the actual data of a given trip offering specified by its key. The actual data include the attributes of the table ActualTripStopInfo.Test your program using several test data for the above transactions.Please submit a hard copy of your program and a printout of all test data and its output in a large envelope.
